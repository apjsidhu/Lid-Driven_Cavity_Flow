# Lid-Driven_Cavity_Flow
A fluid dynamics project done for the MSc Physics course, "Computational Physics", at the University of Groningen. 

## Project description
The aim of this project was to apply the finite differences method to a well-known problem in fluid
dynamics: lid-driven cavity flow. Specifically, the vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations was solved using finite
differences method. Then, different parameters were changed, such as the Reynolds number of the fluid, and the effects studied. 

The Jupyter notebook "Lid-Driven Cavity Flow NOTEBOOK.ipynb" is all thoroughly commented. For supplementary reading refer to 
"Lid-Driven Cavity Flow REPORT.pdf". 

## Files in the repository
"Lid-Driven Cavity Flow REPORT.pdf" is the report associated with the notebook. "Lid-Driven Cavity Flow.ipynb" is the Jupyter notebook.
